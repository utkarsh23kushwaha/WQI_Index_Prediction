# WQI_Index_Prediction
1. Water is one of the most important natural resources for all living organisms on earth. The monitoring of treated wastewater discharge quality is vitally important for the stability and protection of the ecosystem.
2. On a national, regional, and local level, this is significant as a health and development issue. Water quality has been harmed during the past few years by a number of pollutants. 
3. As a result, anticipating and modelling water quality have become crucial for reducing water pollution.
4. In this project for predicting the WQI, Linear Regression Model has been used. 
5. The Dataset used for building the model has 6 parameters on the basis of which WQI is calculated, viz., pH, Conductivity, Total Coliform, Biological Oxygen Deman (BOD), Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Nitrate Concentration.
6. For building the Linear Regression model, 80-20 data split is performed, 80% data used for training the model, 20% data used for testing the model.
7. WQI_Index_Prediction.ipynb holds all the code for this project.
8. Dataset used for this project has been uploaded to this repository : water_dataX.csv 
9. R_2 score for this model came out to be 70.03%.
